### Cello for Android

The Cello SDK for Android enables you to add sharing into your Android app. With a plug-n-play mobile sharing component, your users can easily share their invite link with their friends and network using mobile sharing options convenient for them.

Note, that you will still need to provide access to full featured Cello Referral Component through your web app for your users to be able to claim their rewards

## Installation

You can install Cello for Android using Gradle or manually. A basic installation takes around 15 minutes but will take a little longer if you want to customize the way the Cello Referral Component is launched.

To install Cello for Android, you will need an API key, which you will be provided during onboarding.

### Compatibility
